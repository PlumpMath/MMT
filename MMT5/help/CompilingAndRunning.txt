I compile and run stuff from the command line. If you have a fancy IDE
that knows how to do this for you, feel free to ignore this file, but
if you don't, this should help you compile and run the MMT controller
program.

To compile the project, open a shell and cd into the MMT5
directory. Then run the command

  javac -sourcepath src/ -classpath "bin/;lib/*" -d bin/ src/MMT/Main.java

(NOTE: the semicolon is the path separator for Windows -- for UNIX
operating systems, use a colon instead. So the classpath would be
"bin/:lib/*" instead.)

To run it, cd into MMT5/bin and run

  java -classpath ".;../lib/*" MMT/Main.java
