This file should help you compile and run the MMT controller program
from the command line. That's what I do personally, but if you have a
fancy IDE that can do it for you, feel free to ignore this file.

To compile the project, open a shell and cd into the MMT5
directory. Then run the command

  javac -sourcepath src/ -classpath "bin/;lib/*" -d bin/ src/MMT/Main.java

(NOTE: the semicolon is the path separator for Windows -- for UNIX
operating systems, use a colon instead. So the classpath would be
"bin/:lib/*" instead.)

To run it, cd into MMT5/bin and run

  java -classpath ".;../lib/*" MMT/Main.java
