So, you're in the MMT5 directory. What do you see?

- MMT5/bin/ contains the binary files (i.e. .class files) necessary to
  run the MMT controller code.

- MMT5/help/ contains general documentation that doesn't belong in any
  of the .java files (which should each be thoroughly commented as
  well).

- MMT5/lib/ contains libraries made by other people that we use in
  this package. At the time of writing, there are three .jar files
  (Ftp, Tracker, Utility) to help talk to the laser tracker, and one
  .jar file (JavaFTD2XX-0.2.5) to talk with the actuators.

- MMT5/src/ contains the source files from which we compile the
  controller program.
